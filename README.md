# Introduction
In this lab, I have decided to compare two different locations and see the difference, similiartities, and in general the sentiment. I have chosen **France** and **India** because these countries to me pose different development level, economy, religion, geopolitics, and for many aspects, seems distinct from each other. I also wanted to have countries that have more complex and nuanced languages than English alone. 
## Maps on QGIS
We can see the first analysis of distributions through following 2 images.
### France

As we can see, in France, it seems to be ditributed quite equally. On the other hand if we see the following image of India, we can cluster around New Delhi.
### India

I assume due to the internet access, resources, social media involvement and depending on many aspects, people's geospatial location of tweet differs.
