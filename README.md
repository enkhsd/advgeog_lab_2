# Introduction
In this lab, I have decided to compare two different locations and see the difference, similiartities, and in general the sentiment. I have chosen **France** and **India** because these countries to me pose different development level, economy, religion, geopolitics, and for many aspects, seems distinct from each other. I also wanted to have countries that have more complex and nuanced languages than English alone. 
## Maps on QGIS
We can see the first analysis of distributions through following 2 images.
### France

As we can see, in France, the tweets seem to be ditributed quite equally. On the other hand if we see the following image of India, we can notice the cluster around New Delhi, where I assume more people live and have better connections to the internet.
### India

I assume due to the internet access, resources like computer and mobile phone, social media involvement and the way people get engaged in public discourse certainly diifers. It gets to be demonstrated in the geospatial location of tweets. We can notice overall equally geographically located tweets from France whereas in India, it seems more sparse and erratic. However, we have to be careful here because we do not know how much of the tweets get produced in English versus in other languages that the each country uses. Therefore, in order the make conclusion, we would need more work with the data.

## Word Clouds
In the second part of the lab, we will get introduced to word clouds of each country with corresponding tweets (visualizing most used words). 
### France

In France, the most prevalent words are *"win, vote, EmmanuelMacron, elected, thank,.etc"* . I was not aware of the fact that they were (France) having presidential election on 4/10/22 and 4/24/22. So month of April had huge interest and trend towards presidential election and context around it. This certainly makes sense. Also, it might be the time people and entities get more active on twitter due to the policitical nature of events happening in France.

### India

However, in India, the broadly used words are *"sir, congratulations, Allah, action, stand, mother, etc,."*. There seems to be not an explicit connection or theme regarding the tweets. However, we can see expressions like *Allah* which I would say exactly connected to the context of India and the religion.

In general, it seems to be the case that we can learn the unique aspect of that country through the people's tweet and expression. Especially, if there are some kind of event concerning everyone, there likely be overarching theme and connections in the twitter contents. In the above two countries, we have seen different qualities regarding how people are utilizing twitters and highlighting their opinions. 
The countries share different patterns and words(twitter context). I believe that is due do current events happening in that geographical location, geopolitical atmospheres, religion and people's belief, and also the overall development of the country. Developed countries likely have better internet connection, mobile phone usage, time and resources to be active on twitter, and so on.
