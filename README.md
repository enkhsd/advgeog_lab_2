# Introduction
In this lab, I have decided to compare two different locations and see the difference, similiartities, and in general the sentiment. I have chosen France and India because these countries to me pose different development level, economy, religion, location, and for many aspects, seems distinct from each other. I also wanted to have countries that have more complex and nuanced languages than English alone.
